# Tic-tac-toe
This Tic Tac Toe project was created by me as a learning exercise and is inspired by a CodePen example I came across. I referred to it primarily as a tutorial to understand the game logic and structure, then implemented it by writing the code in my own way based on my understanding. While the CSS design is my own work, it was created from scratch since the original reference used SCSS, a technology I am not yet familiar with. I also took some help online for better understanding and for guidance with certain CSS coding aspects. This project represents my effort to learn and grow, and while it is not entirely original, it reflects my journey of understanding and applying web development concepts.
